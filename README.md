You can use it every day to make your messages, documents and social media posts clear and error-free.

## How does leef work?

Leef discovers grammar, spelling, punctuation, word selection and pattern errors in your writing.

You can copy and paste any English text in the Leef editor or install the free leef add-on for Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge. Leef will help you write correctly on almost all Internet sites.

The Leef algorithms illustrate possible text problems and suggest context-specific corrections for spelling, word, style, punctuation, and even impersonation. Leef explains the logic behind each correction, so you can make an informed decision about whether and how to correct the problem.
